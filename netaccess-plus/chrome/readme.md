## Installation & Usage

#### Option 1:

- Download the [crx file](https://github.com/amitanilkulkarni/instinet/blob/master/netaccess-plus/chrome/Netaccess%20Plus.crx?raw=true) and save it in your home folder/desktop.
- Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
- Drag and drop the crx file from desktop to Chrome. Click on Install when asked.
 
#### Option 2:

- Download [Netaccess Plus.zip](https://github.com/amitanilkulkarni/instinet/blob/master/netaccess-plus/chrome/Netaccess%20Plus.zip?raw=true)
- Extract it to some folder.
- Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and enable developer mode checkbox
- Choose 'Install unpacked extension', and navigate to the folder where you extracted it.

#### Option 3:

- Wait till I gather enough cash to throw at Google to publish it on their store.
- Download and install it from Chrome Store.

 <rant>      Chrome seems to be particularly anal about letting people install packages that are not hosted on their webstore. Hosting it on their webstore needs a one-time $5 contribution, which doesn't make sense since I won't be developing anything else for Google. Apparently there are Alternative distribution options (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/external_extensions), but they all looked complicated when I glanced through them. Pain in the ass. :/ To make things worse, Firefox also seems to be following the same footsteps. WHY, MOZILLA, WHY????!!!! YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!!!      </rant>
