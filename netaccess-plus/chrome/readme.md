## Installation & Usage

#### Option 1:

- Download [Netaccess Plus.zip](https://github.com/amitanilkulkarni/instinet/blob/master/netaccess-plus/chrome/Netaccess%20Plus.zip?raw=true)
- Extract it to some folder.
- Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable developer mode checkbox
- Choose 'Install unpacked extension', and navigate to the folder where you extracted it.
- Enjoy!
 
#### Option 2:

- Download the crx file and google how to install it locally.
- Tell me how you did that.

#### Option 3:

- Wait till I gather enough cash to throw at Google to publish it on their store. :/
- Download and install it from Chrome Store.

    Chrome is particularly anal about letting people install packages that are not hosted on their webstore. Hosting it on their webstore needs a one-time $5 contribution, which I am skeptical to make since I won't be developing anything else for Google. Apparently there are [Alternative distribution options](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/external_extensions). You have the file. Go ahead and knock yourself out. Too bad Firefox is following the same steps. :/
